**E-commerce Project:**
This is an ongoing group project replicating a Manga E-commerce Website, implementing an "offer-up" idea. Users can post their manga for sale and purchase manga from other users. Key features we are implementing include user authentication, posting manga for sale, purchasing manga, and payment integration. This website uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is built on a PERN stack, meaning PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. We are also learning and implementing AWS. I have been assigned the role of full stack developer, collaborating with each team.

**Password Juggernaut:**
This is an Android project focused on generating and storing passwords based on user requests. The languages used for this project are Java and XML. We used a CMV (Controller, Model, View) approach. My role in this project involved designing, mapping, and determining how to store user data securely.
